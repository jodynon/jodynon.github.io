Meet Gladys. Gladys has recently moved into Hilltop due to 
needing increased support as she is living with dementia. 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.500
Last week Gladys was returned to the centre by police after 
following some visitors as they left the centre. 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.200
Let’s check in with care worker Geoff and nurse Aroha 
to see how Gladys is going now.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.700
Aroha, I’m still worried about Gladys. 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800
During the day we’ve noticed some improvement in her behaviour, 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.700
but unfortunately, she’s continuing to walk around 
the corridors in the evening. 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.500
She’s very vocal and insists she has to go home. 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.000
Now you’ve completed an assessment of Gladys, 
and we’ve tried some support strategies 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.500
can we start using a restrictive practice?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.800
- Requirements for the use of restrictive practices are clear, 
they must only be used as a last resort 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.700
as a temporary solution after all alternative behaviour support 
care strategies have been used to their full extent.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.600
In this module you’ll work with Geoff and his colleagues to 
explore the use of alternative behaviour support care strategies. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.900
You will consider how to plan, implement and evaluate care strategies to 
reduce the number of times a behaviour occurs or has an impact, 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.100
and explore the need for consultation, documentation, 
monitoring and reassessment of behaviour.
