- Hi Gladys and Bob, wow aren’t these flowers spectacular! 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000

thank you for sharing with all of us!

- When responding to consumer behaviour, it’s important we treat the 
cause of the behaviour rather than the behaviour itself. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.700
Before we consider the use of restrictive practice we must first 
exhaust all alternative strategies. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.100
Remember the importance of:

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:38.400
person-centred care and consultation when planning the use of care strategies

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.000
documenting the use of strategies, and their effectiveness 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.200
monitoring and reassessing the consumer’s behaviour as required.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.200
