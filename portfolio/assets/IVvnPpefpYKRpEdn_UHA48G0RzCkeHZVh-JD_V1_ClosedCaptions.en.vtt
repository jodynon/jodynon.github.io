Hi my name is Jo Dynon, welcome to my portfolio. 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.300
Throughout this little mini course I hope you find out 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.400
a little bit about me, what makes me tick and where I'd like to go. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
I am a Learning Experience Designer 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.300
who has created both online and blended training solutions 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.400
in Government, contracting and consultancy spaces.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.640
I have a reputation for being well organised, 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.800
with an eye for detail, using technologies to engage, to inspire, to organise. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.100
I enjoy building positive rapports with internal and external stakeholders 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
and providing support to those around me.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.400
I look forward to my next adventure!

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.100
Take a look through this course to find out more about me.
