- Meet Violet

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
- Hello! My name is Violet. 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.000
I am 80 years old and I was quite fit and healthy until my recent fall. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
It’s been awfully hard being injured.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
'Cause for many years I’ve been on my own and I’ve always been independent and looked after myself. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I’m slowly getting used to receiving care.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And I’ve always taken immense pride in keeping my surroundings clean.  

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.500
But now that someone else does the cleaning, well, I feel let down. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.500
It’s not how I would do it.  

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
But I’m not sure if I should mention this to Bijay, he's the person that does my cleaning. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.900
My niece says I should, but I don’t want to bother anyone, maybe I can just do some extra cleaning myself…. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
