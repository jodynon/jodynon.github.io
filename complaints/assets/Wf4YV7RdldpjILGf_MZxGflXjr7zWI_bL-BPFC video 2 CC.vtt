Feedback and complaints play a valuable role in improving the quality of care and services. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Remember...Everyone should be encouraged and supported to provide feedback and make complaints. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
All complaints should be dealt with using your service’s framework which should consider the 6 stages for complaints handling. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.000
All staff have a responsibility to respond positively and appropriately to feedback and complaints.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.500
